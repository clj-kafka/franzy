(defn send-callback
  "Creates a Kafka Java compatible callback for use with a producer send function.

  The callback will execute when the request is complete.
  This callback will generally execute in the background I/O thread so it should be fast, taking minimal time to execute.

  You may pass a Clojure function to create this callback, however it must be of 2 arity.
  The first argument will be record metadata as a map (converted from Java), and the second argument will be an exception.
  Your callback will receive one or the other as a value and should respond accordingly.

  Example:
  (send-callback (fn naming-me-might-help-debug [record-metadata e]
    (println \"Record metadata:\" record-metadata)
    (println \"Kafka said no, here's why:\" e))

  See https://kafka.apache.org/090/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/clients/producer/Callback.html for more details."
